# linked-list-char-count-object

This project implements a C++ class `assign_obj` that manages a linked list of characterâ€“count pairs. Each object supports insertion, merging, compaction, and formatted output. It is designed to demonstrate deep copy, dynamic memory management, and operator overloading using raw pointers in a manually managed singly linked list.

## Overview

The `assign_obj` class internally uses a `node` struct to store characters and their counts. Nodes are dynamically created and manipulated through member functions and overloaded operators.

### Required Features

- Implement the class using a **linked list** (not arrays or STL vectors for storage).
- Must include:
  - A destructor that prints `DELETE`
  - A copy constructor that prints `COPY`
  - An assignment operator that prints `ASSIGNMENT`
- Must not hardcode any values.
- Must be compiled with the flag: `-fno-elide-constructors`

## Key Methods and Operators

- `assign_obj()`: Default constructor.
- `assign_obj(string input)`: Constructs the object from a string, converting characters to uppercase.
- `compact()`: Aggregates duplicate characters and sorts the list alphabetically.
- `f_add(char c)`: Adds a character to the front of the list.
- `e_add(char c)`: Adds a character to the end of the list.
- `operator+`: Merges two objects and compacts the result.
- `operator=`: Performs deep assignment, prints `ASSIGNMENT`.
- Copy constructor: Creates a deep copy of another object, prints `COPY`.
- Destructor: Deletes all nodes, prints `DELETE`.
- `operator<<`: Outputs the list in `[ A:1 B:2 ... ]` format.

## Program Flow

The provided driver performs the following steps:
1. Creates two assign_obj instances from strings.
2. Prints and compacts the first.
3. Copies it using the copy constructor.
4. Merges with the second object using `+` and assigns it back (assignment operator).
5. Adds characters using `f_add` and `e_add`.
6. Compacts and prints the final object.

## Files

- `assign_obj.h`: Class definition and method implementations using a linked list.
- `assign_driver.cpp`: Driver file to test class functionality.

## How to Compile & Run

```bash
g++ -fno-elide-constructors assign_driver.cpp -o run_assign
./run_assign
```

## Notes

- All data is stored as uppercase characters.
- Memory is managed manually using `new` and `delete`.
- No STL algorithms or containers are used for core storage.
- All required outputs (COPY, ASSIGNMENT, DELETE) appear when expected.
- The structure is tested to match assignment output specs without hardcoded behavior.
